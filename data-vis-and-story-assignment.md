# Data Visualisation

### Create a new Project

You will create a new HTML/CSS/JS project, you don't need to use all charts but remeber you will need a new script file for each new chart.

```
data-vis-folder
â”‚   index.html
|   styles.css   
|   scriptBar.js
|   scriptLine.js
|   scriptPie.js
```

### Create a Story

You now need to __Title__ e/or __Subtitle__ your page, write a __paragraph__ about one of the interesting data you have researched and discussed in the last session.
Don't forget to create space for the graph/chart you are going to use as support for you story.

You can use data from one of those references:
